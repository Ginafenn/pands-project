# Fisher Iris Data Set
# Author: Regina Fennessy


The Fisher Data set was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936.
It is made up of 50 data sets from 3 different species of the Iris flower. This was used to quantify the variations of the three species.
Four types of measurements were used from each flower. 
He created a linear discriminant model which was used to tell the three species apart.
