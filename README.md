# Fisher Iris Data Set
# Author: Regina Fennessy


The Fisher Data set was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936.
It is made up of 50 data sets from 3 different species of the Iris flower. 
This was used to quantify the variations of the three species.

Iris Setosa
Iris Vericolour
Iris Virginica

Four types of measurements were used from each flower. 

Sepal lenght in cm
Sepal width in cm
Petal lenght in cm
Petal width in cm

He created a linear discriminant model which was used to tell the three species apart.
