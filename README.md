# Fisher Iris Data Set
# Author: Regina Fennessy


The Fisher Data set was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. Ronald is a british statistician and biologist.It is one of the most used data set
It is made up of 50 data sets from 3 different species of the Iris flower. 
This was used to quantify the variations of the three species.

Iris Setosa
Iris Vericolour
Iris Virginica

Four types of measurements were used from each flower. 

Sepal lenght in cm
Sepal width in cm
Petal lenght in cm
Petal width in cm

He created a linear discriminant model which was used to tell the three species apart.


Libraries Used for this Project:

NumPy: Numpy or Numerical Python was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. Is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is used for working in domain of linear alegbra fourier and matrices
Pandas: Is an open source library used for data analysis/data science and machine learning tasks in python. It is built on top of Numpy which provides support for multi -dimensional arrays
Seaborn: Is a data visualisation library based on matplotlib. It provides a high level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics
matplotlib: Is a library for creating static and interactive visualisation in Python
